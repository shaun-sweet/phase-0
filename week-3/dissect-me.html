	<header>1.1 Think About Time Reflection</header>
		
		<p>Most of the time management and productivity ideas I knew about prior.  One that was new was the “Pomodoro” technique.

		Time boxing is a strategy that is incorporated in the Pomodoro technique.  It is basically the idea that you will set aside a certain amount of time to do only one, or a group of things, and only those things.  I can use that to make seemingly endless work broken into bite sized chunks and see measurable, consistent progress.</p>
