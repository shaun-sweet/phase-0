<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was very straight forward!  We took our time and got a lot done
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Great!  I only was able to incorporate one element into the page, but I think with some reflection I could "refactor" my page to incorporate one or two more.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
That was difficult.  We started formatting then remembered we weren't supposed to and axed it.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It's clunky feeling.  But We tried to use as minimal as possible to get the most done.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Write out the skeleton of the HTML first!! If you know you'll need a tag, put the tag down and fill in the raw text after!  For example, we knew we needed 13 links as a unordered list item, so we pasted 13 of them in and just filled them in as we went.  Much Smoother!
