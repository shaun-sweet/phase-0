#How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
You can actually real-time change the attributes of your elements inside the document using the DevTools inspector.  This allows you to make changes and see the result of them in real time instead of having to save your changes and reload the page to see them.  

#How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
width: px % em
height: px % em


#What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute positioning positions itself relative to the first parent anchored element.  That could be the viewport, or a relative positioned element.  Fixed positions the element in relation to ONLY the viewport.  This is how nav bars "float" on the top of browser pages.  Static positioning is basically the default.  It basically takes on the flow of the page.  Relative can take top, left, right, and bottom attributes.  It is positioned "relative" to where it is placed and you can align that with those attributes I've listed here.

#What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
So the margin is the distance that an element forces other elements AWAY from it.  The border dictates basically where the element ends but also where the margin starts.   Padding is the distance between the content the element houses and the border of the actual element.  I think this is the best way I could word this!


#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I enjoyed it.  I had done most of the other challenges before this one (unfortunately) so I had actually learned most of this prior to actually having done this.  But that was ok because I did end up learning a thing or two from this challenge.  Overall, I found this challenge to be quite fun :)
