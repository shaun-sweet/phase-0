Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
go to www.github.com.  Login with your username and password.  On the top right of the screen, you'll see a big + symbol.  Click that and hit create new repository.  Fill in a name for the repository. Then at the top, it has a url that looks like git@github.com:sweetkeys/dfadfa.git but obviously it will have what you just typed in for the name.  Copy that, then open up your terminal app.  type "git clone" then paste into the command line after clone (make sure there is a space after clone).  Congrats!! You're now a programmer :D

Describe what open source means. 
Open source means that anyone is free to use or alter the software.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I doesn't make me nervous or protective.  I think it feels more like a utopia!  I like that the digital manifestation of ideas are free and open for anyone to use and build upon from there :)

Assess the importance of using licenses.
With a business product I think licenses are absolutely critical.  

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I felt like I got a  better feel for how branches worked.  My "aha" moment was when I realized that branches aren't automatically sync'd to github.  I kept wondering where all these branches I had created were going to go after merging into the master branch!

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12370714/git-how-do-i-list-only-local-branches
I had some branches I created toying around and then remembered they are separate from github until you push them.  so I deleted the branch from github but hadn't deleted them from my machine.  This helped me solve that problem.
