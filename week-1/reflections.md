1.1 Think About Time Reflection
Most of the time management and productivity ideas I knew about prior.  One that was new was the “Pomodoro” technique.

Time boxing is a strategy that is incorporated in the Pomodoro technique.  It is basically the idea that you will set aside a certain amount of time to do only one, or a group of things, and only those things.  I can use that to make seemingly endless work broken into bite sized chunks and see measurable, consistent progress.

Honestly? I suck at managing my time because I am not in a role that really requires that of me.  Basically, I don’t.  I look forward to developing this skill.

Well, yes it works because I don’t really need to do it.  Until now.

No, haha, using my strategies now will result in stressing me out and making this much much harder than it needs to be.

My overall plan is to use trello to track things that need to be researched/done and basically have something that needs to be done as a “card” at all times so that any downtime I have, I can be working towards my career.  I will definitely be employing some mindfulness techniques I read about.  I especially like the idea of meditation being tiny bits of practicing getting back on track.  Anyone who knows me knows I am easily distracted :P
