// Eloquent JavaScript

// Run this file in your terminal using `node my_solution.js`. Make sure it works before moving on!

// Program Structure
// Write your own variable and do something to it.
// prompt("what is your favorite food?");
// console.log("hey, that is my favorite too");




// Complete one of the exercises: Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, or Chess Board
// var x = "#";
// for (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
// 	console.log(x);
// 	x = x + "#";
// }
// Triangle



// Functions

// Complete the `minimum` exercise.
// function min(a, b) {
// 	if (a > b) {
// 		console.log(b);
// 	}
// 	else	{
// 		console.log(a);
// 	}
// }
// min(2,3)

// Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
// Create an object called "me" that stores your name, age, 3 favorite foods, and a quirk below.

// var me = {
// 	name: "shaun",
// 	age: 27,
// 	favoriteFoods: ["pizza", "icecream", "beer"],
// 	quirk: "I like pina colada"
// };
// console.log(me.favoriteFoods)

// What are the biggest similarities and differences between JavaScript and Ruby?
// I felt the gist was pretty identical.  Objects are definitely different in javascript.  They feel more like hashes than "objects".  There is a huge differences
// in javascript syntax.  It is definitely not nearly as pretty.  Much it makes me feel more comfortable programming overall.

// Was some of your Ruby knowledge solidified by learning another language? If so, which concepts??
// I think that iteration was solidified a bit.  Also objects in general.  It was cool seeing how things like .length are just a property of the particular string you've invoked.
// I related to that ruby

// How do you feel about diving into JavaScript after reading these chapters?
// I am excited! I am a little nervous to start, but excited to branch off a bit!
