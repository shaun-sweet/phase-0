 // Design Basic Game Solo Challenge

// This is a solo challenge

// Your mission description:
// Overall mission:
// Goals:  I want to make a typing game mixed with some action RPG.  So basically, think sonic where you collect fairly meaningless coins.  You'll collect these coins and 
//  once you hit a certain number of coins, you'll be able to turn into super sonic.  Once you can turn ito super sonic, you'll be able to kill the bad guy, which is 
// baddie mcbadderface
// You'll collect coins by simply having to type something simple, like a command get.coin or whatever.  That will get you a coin.  
// Experiment with making it more difficult to acquire coins but MVP is this:
// Simply start the game, as Goodington McGooder and you'll have your quest to gather coins, once you get the amount of coins needed, turn into Super Goodington McGooder
// and relinquish the world of Baddie McBaddieface!  Are you up to the challenge?
