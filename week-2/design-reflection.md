What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The goal of my site is to be able to have a link on hand (on a biz card) and give a professional site that represents me and my work.  It will feature my portfolio as well as a blog with technical advice!

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience is employers as well as aspiring web developers and helping guide them in the right direction!  I will use the blog two fold.  It will be there to help me flesh out my own ideas and help with some SEO on popular terms, thus tossing my own name out into the wild and getting more exposure.  I will also provide insight on various things I deem worthy of being on my site :P 


What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I want them to content me.  To engage with the content on my site.  I want them to do all the above.  Look at my content... use it... search it.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
Make it simple.  Make it EASY.  In the words of apple.... make it JUST WORK.  There is nothing more frustrating to me than people using different design languages that you have to relearn just to be different.  There is a standard design language out there and not increasing the barrier to using your work is key in my humble and correct opinion.  :P


What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is something I interpret as designing with the mindset of making it easy for the user to use your site.  Keeping all their desired actions in mind and making sure it is the easiest for them to use.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Honestly the challenge was fairly easy, I did however get stuck on ONE big part.  I got stuck on moving a file... the site-map.png i had basically taken a screenshot of the site map I put together on writemaps.  I wanted to move the file first so I looked up a few methods on google to make the job easy.  I remembered before using a command to copy onto my clipboard something so I found that one because I wanted to take the command pwd and pipe that to the copy command which I learned is pbcopy so I could do mv filename.png pasteDirHere which I couldn't actually get working till later.  I was putting in pbpaste which is a variable that puts whatever is on your clipboard in place.  But in this situation it was interpretting it as a string and doing nothing for me... so I basically renamed my file to that haha.  Then I moved it and typed in the move manually and that went through fine.  But somehow I couldn't move it into a directory I wanted to using mv file /folder it said permission denied.... so I have a little bit of linux experience from my work at godaddy.com and figured it was a permission thing.  I basically spent an hour figuring out it wasn't a permission thing and ended up using the CORRECT command which was mv file FOLDER (with no slash at the start) and that did it.  But I did learn a LOT about permissions. see (https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3l008h/eli5_linuxunix_permissions/) that was SUPER helpful.  Execute permissions isn't super intuitive for directories.  This fixed that issue.
