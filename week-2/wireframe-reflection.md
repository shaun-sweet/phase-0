##What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is getting your idea and plan for your website on paper(either digitally or otherwise).  A visual representation of a website without having it coded.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?
It helps give you an idea of what to code.  It is a visual guide to what you need to build and how.  It helps get ideas out of your head and into the physical realm.

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yea, it was pretty fun.  I got to learn how to use some wireframing software which was interesting.  It was fairly user friendly.  I used Sketch.  I think I will buy it.  

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I stuck with my first idea.  If I want to revise it, I will do so later on.  I don't think it needs to be super fancy.  Just easy to read.  

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
It was mostly related to the design software I was using.  I could not figure out how their "art boards" worked and how to duplicate them.  The resources I used included clicking things in the software until I figured out what they did haha.  

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I liked once I got a little workflow down in the software.  It was pretty fun and felt like I was "building" my site!  I found getting the image to show up inline on the markdown reflection files to be fairly tedious.  I couldn't figure out how it was intrepretting the URL I was putting in.  After many commits, I figured it out.  It seems it assumes you are in the repo depending if you start the url with a / or not.  That was fun.
